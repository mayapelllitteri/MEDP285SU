     <h4> What do you hope to learn in this class?</h4>
        <p> 1. I look forward to learning CSS and practicing how to create aesthetic web design with shortcuts.    </p>

        <p> 2. I am also looking forward to learning Animation. It will be exciding to add more interactive aspects to the final project. </p> 

    <h4>Do you have experience with coding (html, css, javascript)?</h4>
        <p> I took MEDPL 150: Visual Communication and Interactive Design this past spring semester where I got begginner's expereince with HTML and CSS. The course focused mostly on HTML for the coding portion with a little bit of CSS at the end. We also learned Photoshop, Illistrator, basics of photography, and principles of use UX. Understanding user expereience has helped me reconginze effective website designs and how to incorperate them into my own work.   </p> 

     <h4>Do you have a media production superpower (Photoshop, Photography, Animation, Illustration, etc.)?</h4>
        <p> I am a begginer to media work in general, but have most expereince in photography and editing. I became interested in photography as a teenager learned from highschool classes and self exploration. I was suprised how much I enjoyed coding last semester and am interested in learning more about it. Right now I am want to improve my skills in all these areas and find a media superpower soon!   </p>
