<h3>Long Bio</h3>
<p>Laura Splan is a New York City based artist working at the intersections of Science, Technology, and Culture. Her research-based studio practice and interdisciplinary collaborations culminate in multimedia artworks, exhibitions, and events. With an approach grounded in what she calls the “tactical tactile”, her work cultivates intuitive comprehension of the interconnectedness of cultural and biological systems. She reframes artifacts of the posthuman landscape to interrogate the “GUI/gooey” or liminal spaces that mediate our relationship to nature and to our bodies. Through embodied encounters that leverage sensations of touch, light, and sound, Splan’s work engages audiences with complexity through curiosity, wonder, and play. Recent projects have included immersive multisensory experiences, interactive installations, networked devices, participatory sculptures, and intimately scaled objects. Her companion lectures and workshops unpack the conceptual layers and timely themes in her work while providing insight into laboratory techniques, specialized software, and textiles methods used in her studio.
